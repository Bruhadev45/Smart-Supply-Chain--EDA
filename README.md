# Smart Supply Chain EDA

## Project Overview

The **Smart Supply Chain EDA** project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a supply chain dataset. The objective is to analyze and gain insights into different areas of supply chain operations such as demand forecasting, inventory management, supplier performance, and logistics optimization.

## Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values and outliers.
- Visualize data to uncover patterns and trends in the supply chain.
- Analyze correlations between variables to identify key factors impacting performance.
- Provide actionable insights to improve supply chain efficiency and decision-making.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing data, duplicates, and correct formatting issues.
- **Data Visualization**: Create charts and graphs to illustrate trends in the data.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Apply basic statistics to understand data distribution.
- **Trend Analysis**: Spot patterns in demand, inventory, and supplier metrics.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identify relationships between variables affecting the supply chain.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: Primary programming language for analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For visualizing data.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For executing and documenting the analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains details about supply chain operations, including information on products, suppliers, inventory levels, and demand. The dataset will be preprocessed to remove any anomalies and ensure data consistency.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-supply-chain-eda.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```bash
   cd smart-supply-chain-eda
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Open the Jupyter Notebook to begin the analysis.
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook smart_supply_chain_eda.ipynb
   ```

## Insights

This EDA will help in understanding key supply chain metrics such as:
- Seasonal demand patterns.
- Inventory levels vs. demand fluctuations.
- Supplier performance and lead times.
  
These insights will contribute to better decision-making for supply chain optimization.
